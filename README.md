# Dzongkha Next Syllables Prediction
Dzongkha typing is time-consuming, burdensome, and irksome. A word in Dzongkha is formed by either a single syllable or multiple syllables. A single syllable རྒྱུ (property) requires six different keypresses and the multiple syllabic word ས་སྨུག་སྤུབས་སྤུབསཔ (cloudy) requires 22 keys to be pressed. Similarly, most of the syllables and words require several keypresses that make Dzongkha typing tedious and laborious.
